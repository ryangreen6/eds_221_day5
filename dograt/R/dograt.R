# Hello, world!
#
# This is an example function named 'hello'
# which prints 'Hello, world!'.

#
# Some useful keyboard shortcuts for package authoring:
#
#   Install Package:           'Cmd + Shift + B'
#   Check Package:             'Cmd + Shift + E'
#   Test Package:              'Cmd + Shift + T'

hello <- function() {
  print("Hello my name is dograt I am both rat and dog")
  print("kachow")
}

# when creating a new package, you'll start from a template package from R called 'hello'. Once you make changes, you have to reload the whole package to get those changes. To do that, go to the Build tab by the environment, and hit Install! This will restart R and your changed package should be functional.
